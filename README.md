# System Properties LARP Win9x Resources
These are resources necessary for a Win9x-styled System Properties
using the System Properties LARP mod. The original SYSDM.CPL from
Win9x is 16-bit and as such cannot be loaded from Win32 applications
like the System Properties applet. Therefore, this custom DLL is
needed for Win9x System Properties resources.
